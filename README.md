Requirements
The application is built for screens of full HD resolution, 1920x1080p. It is built to play on a computer, as well as on the window platform. To play, enter the game build folder and double click on the application with the .exe file extension.

Bugs/Limitations
While interacting with certain things, such as doors, or enemies, there may be some issues encountered.
Doors – Sometimes, when turning away from the door, it may close on you. Standing too far away from the door may also lead to it being unable to open.
Enemies – Sometimes, when the enemy damages the player, the appropriate text would not show up on the screen. Prolonged contact with the enemy would also not damage the player. When the enemies touch the player, they do not stop moving, even if the player is still. This may result in the player being pushed by enemies, sometimes getting pushed out of bounds.

Answers
The different collectibles, or “special” items, are, a key, gun, health potion, as well as a golden eye. 
Key – The key is found on the far-left corner of the room the player first starts out in, behind trees.
Gun – The gun is found in the locked room which required a key to enter. It is behind damage blocks.
Health potion – The potion is found in the unlocked room near the key. If the player jumps up the blocks, they may find it. The second potion is found behind the large staircase which leads towards the escape. It is hidden in a Pandora’s box,  where once shot, it will drop out as loot, along with enemies which attack the player.
Golden Eye – The golden eye would be gained from killing the enemy with the golden eye where the player spawns. It will drop as loot.
